# VLMEmbed

## Set up env

(Use python3.11 for proper running)

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
cd VLM_Embed
python -m venv vlm
source vlm/bin/activate
```

## Set up

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download dataset

1. Download the eval image file zip from huggingface (`optional`)

```bash
cd VLM_Embed
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMEB-eval/resolve/main/images.zip
unzip images.zip -d eval_images/
```

1. Download train image, it can take > 1 hour to download

```bash
cd VLM_Embed
bash download_traindata.sh
bash download_traindata_2.sh
```

1. Fix some line code

Because of the error of code in **Transformers library**, run the following script to find the error and comment some lines:

Just comment the following code, from line 140 to 143 in file **/vlm/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/models/qwen2_vl/image_processing_qwen2_vl.py**:

```python
if size is not None and ("shortest_edge" not in size or "longest_edge" not in size):
    raise ValueError("size must contain 'shortest_edge' and 'longest_edge' keys.")
else:
    size = {"shortest_edge": 56 * 56, "longest_edge": 28 * 28 * 1280}
```

Or run `fix_lib.py` to fix:

```python
python fix_lib.py
```

## Training

Just run the scripts in folder `scripts`

- For run RKD:

```bash
bash scripts/train_RKD.sh
bash scripts/train_distill_propose_V.sh
```

## Inference & Evaluation

1. To evaluate our model on an MMEB dataset (e.g., MSCOCO_i2t), run:

```bash
bash eval.sh
```

## Acknowledgement

- We have adapted code from [VLM2Vec]([https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/VLM2Vec]) and [B3](https://github.com/raghavlite/B3)
